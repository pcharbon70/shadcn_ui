# Internal release process

Milestone A produces an internal `0.1.0` candidate. It does not authorize or
perform publication to Hex.

## Candidate verification

From a clean checkout and `packages/shadcn_ui`:

1. Run `mix deps.get --locked` and `npm ci`.
2. Run `npm run assets:build` and `npm run assets:check`.
3. Run `mix precommit`, `mix docs`, and `mix hex.build`.
4. Inspect the archive against `package/0`'s explicit allowlist.
5. Verify the archive contains public modules, compiled CSS, README, changelog,
   provenance, notices, and Mix metadata only.

The archive must reject `.spec`, demo sources and exports, scripts, workflows,
tests, `_build`, `deps`, `doc`, `node_modules`, source maps, remote runtime
assets, credentials, and mutable user data. The checked-in lockfiles remain
repository verification inputs and are not package contents.

Gallery publication and rollback are independent of the package candidate and
are documented in `demo/DEPLOYMENT.md`.
